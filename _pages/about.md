Hi, I'Sun Yongkang, a PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where I conduct research in big data analytics under the supervision of Dr. [Shi Jieming](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~jiemshi/). I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree with honors from the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/) and the [Hongyi Honor College](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/) at Wuhan University, where I worked on several projects related to computer vision and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the [BRAIN lab](https://www.zhiyuteam.com/) under the guidance of Prof. [Guo Chi](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/guochi). In January 2026, I started an internship at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), Douyin Risk Control Group (Shenzhen), conducting research on content safety and multimodal foundation models.

My research interests include:
- **Big Data Analytics and Data Mining**, especially Table Understanding.
- **Multimodal Foundation Models**, especially Content Safety.

If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:yongkang.sun@connect.polyu.hk).
