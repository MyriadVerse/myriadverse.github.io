Sun Yongkang is a PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). He graduated with an honor Bachelor of Engineering degree from the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/) and the [Hongyi Honor College](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/) at Wuhan University (WHU).

He is currently pursuing a PhD in the PolyU, shifting his research focus to big data analytics under the supervision of Dr. [Shi Jieming](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~jiemshi/). Previously, he had worked on some interesting projects about computer vision and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the [BRAIN lab](https://www.zhiyuteam.com/) at WHU, under the guidance of Prof. [Guo Chi](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/guochi).

My research interests include machine learning, data mining and databases, particularly focusing on tabular data. If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:yongkang.sun@connect.polyu.hk).

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
