Sun Yongkang is a PhD student in the [Department of Computing](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/) at Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU). He graduated with an honor Bachelor of Engineering degree from the [School of Computer Science](https://cs.whu.edu.cn/) and the [Hongyi Honor College](https://hyxt.whu.edu.cn/) at Wuhan University (WHU).

He is currently pursuing a PhD in the PolyU, shifting his research focus to big data analytics under the supervision of Dr. [Shi Jieming](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~jiemshi/). Previously, he had worked on some interesting projects about computer vision and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in the [BRAIN lab](https://www.zhiyuteam.com/) at WHU, under the guidance of Prof. [Guo Chi](https://jszy.whu.edu.cn/guochi).

My research interests include machine learning, data mining and databases, particularly focusing on tabular data. If you are interested in any form of academic collaboration, please feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:yongkang.sun@connect.polyu.hk).
